The following analysis types are not fully supported in the way a dedicated trading platform might be. This file documents the limitations.

1.  **مناطق الطلب والعرض (Supply/Demand Zones)**: The bot simulates this by identifying high-volume nodes from a volume profile (POC and HVNs). This is a strong indicator but differs from classic supply/demand zone analysis which is based on price action and order flow.
2.  **Naming Specificity**: The bot attempts to name levels descriptively (e.g., "Fibonacci", "Trend"), but the exact naming might differ slightly from the user's template as it depends on the data returned by the underlying analysis modules.
